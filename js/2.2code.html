   // where to place the code
// Now that you are going to start to write your own functions, it is easier to separate code from content
// Javascript code can be placed in the body, head or in an external file


// when javaScript functions are declared in the head section they are separated from the content
// use the script tag


               // Debugging your code
// As your code becomes more comples, make sure that you are using your debugger
// the console is your friend

                              // codePen
// If you work on your code an online editor the software let you separate Html, css and JavaScript without any links


                        // review
// js code in the body or the head tag
// code can also be placed in an external file
// personally, I develop in the same file and move to external file

                        // Oraganizing your code 
      // folder Structure
// Web development tend to organize their code into separate parts
   // 1> HTML 2> CSS 3> Images 4> JavaScript
   

                     // linking from CSS file

                        // Debugging 
   // if a link isn't working you want to check a few things:
      // Did you spell the file names correctly? (Case Matters!!)
      // Are files are in the correct folder
      // Are you working on the correct file?
