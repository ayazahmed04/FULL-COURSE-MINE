                        // Adding the interactivity!!
//   It has been up to us to decide when the functions shouls executes
// it would be better if the functions were called bassed on special "events";
// The javaScript API lats us add dynamic function Calls 

                  // Events
// onclick
//  > User clicks on an HTML element
// onmouseover 
// > user moves the mouse over an HTML element
// onresize
// > browser window is resized
// onload
// > browser finishes loading page


                  // How it works
// Any element can react to an event.
// You need to add the event to the tag and include what you want to happen
// e.g.,
/*
const message = () => {
   prompt("what is your name")
}
*/ 
// you can use single or the double quotes for the event result
// Double quotes make it easier if you want to pass String parameters
// Be carefull by copied and past the quotes
function message(msg) {
   document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = `${msg} events is being loading`;
   // prompt("the event is fire")
}

function displayDate() {
   // document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=Date();
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=Location();
}

               // Events Change the Program Flow
   // some programs ran in a linear order (step-by-step)
   // Events cause the  program to "run continuously" since the DOM is always listening for events 
   
               // More Events
   // MOuse Events 
      // onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, onmousemove, onmouseout,...
   // Keyboard Events
      // onkeydown, onkeypress , onkeyup
   // Frame Events
      //  onload, onresize, onscroll, onerror,...
   // comprehensive list:
      // go to mozilla network and search events
   
                  // Review 
   //  without the events, JavaScript would be limited in ability to interact the DOM
   // Events are cool....they are also annoying 
   // Don't worry about memorizing the different events. As the need arises, look them up
