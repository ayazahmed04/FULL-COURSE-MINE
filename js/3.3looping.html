   // We will use a for loop
   // the syntax is:

   //  >> Run a Boolean test case (true/false)
   // >> Run the code 
   // >> Update your variable, go back to 2.

4 - Increment  // it goes back to 2(condition-evaluted)

// if the condition is (flase ) then no more code you have to be run

                     <!-- Review -->
<!-- Loooping is used for much more that arrays -->
<!-- YOu can loopfrom low number to high number , high number to low number , or even just a subset -->
<!-- Once again Practice -->
