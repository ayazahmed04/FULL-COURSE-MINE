// => browser default styling
=> the same html file is look different when  viewed in different browsers.
    - some tags are supported but some aren't 
    - Browser may have different default  styles
    - IN general, defaults looks are very plain


// => Adding styles
    -there are two types of adding styles in your html
    <h1 styles = "color:blue">style heading</h1>


// => Rule syntax
 -Brackets and semicoloons are very important
 -This is where a good editor can make a BiG difference
 
// => use !important for the best css style whose want not to change
 - color names(blue,red,yellow, etc.) work,

    }
