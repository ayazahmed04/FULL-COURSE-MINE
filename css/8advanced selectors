     Styling Specific Objects
- We have focused on type seclector
- What if you don't wnt ot style all of the links, just some?
   =>>Or just some of the lists
- CSS gives you a lot of option


                CSS selector 
    => some Selector folllow the DOM
    => Descendant selector (nav a)
        > styles all of the anchor links inside a nav tag
    => Child selector (nav>a)
        > more contraining The anchor elements must be a child of the nav, no intermediate tags,  e.g., paragraph
    => Adjacent Sibling(hl + ol)
        > elements must be at same level and follow each other 
    => All Siblings (h1~ol)

                        Id selector
    #id selector 
        > used ot identify a single elements in the DOM 
        > Was used extensively for <div id="header">, <div id='gooter'> , etc.
        There is a small movement ot move the use of id OUt of CSS 
        

                    >class selector
    // used to identify an element in the DOM that is part of a special class of items
    // Thinks of thumbnails images, all of the links that are in the navigation , your social media images, etc....


                    /* difference b/w class and id*/
    .(period ) is for classess  & #(pound) for id 
    >classes can be used multiple times 
    ?id shoul be unique
    



                /* Narrowing the classess*/
    => As you get more advanced pages you will want ot narrow the scope of the action
     > p.main => paragraph usion main class 
     > header img.special => Paragraph inside header that use special class 
                

                /*Expanding the Scope*/
    => You can combine elements with a comma  - p, h1, #main,.special {... rules to applly to all of them...}
      > the best way to not changing the element is to be used the !important
      >!important


                /* More  Attribute Selector*/
                universal Selector
    -* applies styling to every element on the page 
    - Ackk!! Try this!

                /*Attribute Selectors */
    - a[href='info.html'] 
       >> this is used to select the tag whose attribute is href=info.html
     => pseudo-classes 
     => pseudo-Elements 

                => attribute    SELECTOR 
    > You may want to search the DOM for certain elements that have an attribute you are looking for 
            > All the images that use gif files....
            > All of the images that have empty alt text....
            >All of the links that goes to the government sites
            


            /* Using Operators*/
    => Operators can be used to find those attribute values you are looking for 
            ^ :match the begining element exactly
                a[href^='http://yazi']
    => $ : match the end exactlly
           img[src$='.png'] >> apply to all png images 
    => :wildcard
            a[href*='yazi']
                >> if you see any "yazi" in the href apply the selector in it
