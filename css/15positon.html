    <!-- Positionnig elements is key to achieving desired layouts -->
    <!-- > proper planning will make this easier -->
    


                <!-- Z-index  -->
    <!--  Multiple elements may be placed in the same position. -->
    <!-- z-index is a numeric value, positive or  negative that dictates stacking order -->




                    <!-- Positioning -->   
    <!-- the four transition properties are
        >static > relative >absolut & >fixed -->

    <!-- Position are modified by the properties top, bottom, left, right -->


                <!-- Static (normal, default ) -normal-flow   -->
    <!-- Default value for elements -->
    <!-- (default) -->
    <!-- place in the next availabe position -->
    <!-- Not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties  
        static not have these properties in the CSS
         top, bottom, left , right -->


                <!-- Relative -->
    <!--  -->
    <!-- Positioned "relative to itself" -->
    <!-- let's move from -->
    <!-- take the static position, but add offsets -->
    <!-- The new positioning doesn't affect any other element. It is possible to move an element and leave a big hole where it would have been -->
    <!-- Relative Positioned elements are often used as container blocks for other elements -->
    <!-- in this add number to moves things e.g., top, bottom, left and right -->


                <!-- Absolute -->
    <!-- Elements is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to it's nearest ancestor(or the root) -->
    <!-- Others elements behave as if elements doesn't exist -->
    <!-- can end up on top of another element -->
    <!-- it start from it's nearest parrent position  -->

                <!-- `Fixed -->
    <!-- this is the fixed position is used to make the browser thing of the pop-up boxes -->
    <!-- A navigtion bar that is always set into the top -->
